# Snake 🐍
Simplified version of Snake, written in (functional) TypeScript and drawn on a `<canvas>` element. 

## Rules
Thanks to a setting on my Nokia 3310 where you could disable the borders of Snake, I have built a version of this game with an infinite loop where you can only die by bumping into yourself. Which is kinda great, actually. 

## What needs to be done
- [ ] Add support for multiple levels
- [ ] Some design love 💔
- [ ] Pause button, time stamps, etc. 
- [ ] Adjustable size of the canvas
